# Employee Database Management CLI

Thanks for visiting my project! This is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Getting the app Started

You will need both Node.js & MySql Server installed onto your machine.
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- MySQL Server (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql)

You will then need to open an integrated terminal in sql-employee-tracker, login to your MySql Server. Then source/seed the database then quit.
- Source db/schema.sql
- source db/seeds.sql

Then in the terminal you will need to run node server.js to start the CLI application.
